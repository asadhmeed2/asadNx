### `Thought process`
split the project into 3 apps :
  1. admin
  2. new-react-app
  3. asad-backend
  4. library for shared code and types.

#### `the admin website`  
we have three forms:
    1. experience.
    2. projects.
    3. personal info. 
          
#### `the new-react-app` 
we have three components:
        1. experience.
        2. projects. 
        3. personal info.
